2. Show specialized technical response
3. Send: `"What design patterns would help refactor this?"`
4. Point out technical depth of responses

**Key Points:**
- Specialized AI behavior
- Contextual responses
- Professional-level assistance

#### **Step 4: Show AI Room Features**
**Say:** *"AI rooms have additional features for serious AI work."*
